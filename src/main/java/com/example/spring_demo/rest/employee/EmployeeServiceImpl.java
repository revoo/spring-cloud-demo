        // It forces you to consider what to return to the absent-case whereas null can be used to denote an error
        // or an absent value or a bug.
        // There have also been criticism about the get() method on the Optional class. If you invoke it on
        // an empty (i.e. null) Optional object you still get a NullPointerException which isn't any better
        // than just using nulls in the first place. So essentially, Optional is a tool to express your
        // intent in a more explicit way (denoting the absent-case of a value) and utilize the public methods
        // of Optional to work with null (absent-values) in a more explicit way.
